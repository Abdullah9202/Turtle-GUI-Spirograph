# Turtle Spirograph Drawing

This project uses the `turtle` module in Python to draw a spirograph with randomized colors. The `turtle` module is a standard Python library that provides a way to draw graphics programmatically.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (standard library, no need to install separately)

## Description

The script creates a spirograph using a turtle object. The colors of the spirograph are randomized using RGB values.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using Python.

```sh
python source.py
